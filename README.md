## Data Collection & Visualization of Hungarian NB1 Football from 1980-2022

- Data was sourced from [magyarfutball.hu](https://www.magyarfutball.hu/hu/merkozesek)
- The script uses BeautifulSoup4 to extract data from the html pages
- Parses them into a MatchResults list which contains:
  - Match season and round (fordul√≥)
  - Match date and time
  - Match location and participating teams
  - Match results
  - Attendance (Viewers who attended locally) _(where data is available)_
- The results then get parsed into a Pandas DataFrame where additional modifications can be done
  - Also saves the dataframe to a .csv file

- Can be modified for other year ranges as well
---

### Using the extracted data we can quickly create visualizations using [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) (or a visualization library of our choice) to make observations

The COVID-19 Pandemic caused attendance to decrease a lot (probably near zero due to averaging)
